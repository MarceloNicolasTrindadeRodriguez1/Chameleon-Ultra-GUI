# Chameleon Ultra - Web App GUI
The Chameleon Ultra is the ultimate RFID emulation device, offering low and high-frequency emulation, full read & write capabilities, bleeding-edge cracking, and wireless control. All of this is packed into a key-chain sized, fully open-sourced device.

# Features
Multi-frequency Emulation: Supports emulation of both low and high-frequency RFID cards.
Full Read & Write Capabilities: Allows users to read from and write to RFID cards.
Bleeding-edge Cracking: Utilizes advanced techniques for cracking RFID cards.
Wireless Control: Can be controlled wirelessly for convenient usage.
How it Works
The Chameleon Ultra is the result of exceptional engineering ingenuity. The development team discovered a little-known RFID function in a popular Bluetooth controller that could be pushed to provide high-performance, multi-frequency RFID reading, writing, and cracking. This discovery led to the creation of the Chameleon Ultra, a tiny, high-performance RFID companion device for multi-frequency RFID emulation, cracking, reading, and writing.

# Getting Started
To get started with the Chameleon Ultra, follow these steps:

- Hardware Setup: Connect the Chameleon Ultra device to your computer or mobile device.
- Software Installation: Install the necessary software drivers and applications for controlling the device.
- Usage: Explore the capabilities of the Chameleon Ultra by emulating, reading, writing, and cracking RFID cards.
